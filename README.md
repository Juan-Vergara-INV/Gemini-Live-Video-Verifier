- Current processing stage
- Memory usage monitoring
- Frame processing status

### 5. QA Report (Screen 3)

Review comprehensive results including:

- **Overall Quality Score**: Pass/Fail status
- **Detailed Detection Results**: Individual findings with confidence scores
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of detections
- **Export Options**: Send results to Google Sheets

## üéØ Analysis Types

### 1. Text Detection

**Purpose**: Identifies specific text content in video frames using OCR

**Target Texts**:

- "2.5 Flash" - Flash configuration detection
- "Eval Mode: Native Audio Output" - System mode verification

**Process**:

1. Frame extraction at specified intervals
2. Image preprocessing (denoising, thresholding)
3. OCR text recognition using Tesseract
4. Fuzzy text matching with error correction
5. Bounding box detection and screenshot capture

### 2. Audio Language Analysis

**Purpose**: Verifies language fluency and accuracy in speech

**Features**:

- Multi-language support (15+ languages)
- Whisper-based transcription
- Fluency scoring algorithms
- Confidence assessment

**Process**:

1. Audio extraction from video
2. Voice activity detection
3. Speech segmentation
4. Language identification using Whisper
5. Fluency assessment based on multiple factors

**Fluency Indicators**:
