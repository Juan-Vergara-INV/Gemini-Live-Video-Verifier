## üö® Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Check Docker has sufficient resources allocated
- Try rebuilding: "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"

### Tesseract Not Working
- The setup script installs Tesseract and language packs
- If issues persist, rebuild the container

### Port Conflicts
- If port 8501 is in use, VS Code will automatically use the next available port
- Check the PORTS tab in VS Code's terminal panel

### Performance Issues
- Allocate more memory to Docker Desktop (recommended: 4GB+)
- Close unnecessary applications
